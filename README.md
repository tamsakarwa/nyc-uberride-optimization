## 📌 Project Overview  
Uber faces **increasing ride cancellations and long rider wait times** in New York City due to an imbalance between **driver availability** and **customer demand**.  

This project provides a **comprehensive data analysis** of ride request patterns, cancellation rates, and driver utilization to identify **high-impact solutions** for reducing cancellations and optimizing driver allocation.  

✨ *A Data Analytics Portfolio Project showcasing SQL, Python ML, and BI tools.*  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze cancellation trends by **time, location, and driver behavior**.  
- Identify **peak demand hours** and **shortage of drivers**.  
- Develop **predictive ML models** to forecast cancellations.  
- Create **interactive dashboards** (Tableau & PowerBI) for stakeholders.  
- Suggest **data-driven solutions** to minimize cancellations.

## 📈 Key Insights  
✅ High cancellations during **weekday peak hours (7–9 AM, 5–8 PM)**.  
✅ Specific NYC zones show **driver shortages** leading to longer ETAs.  
✅ New drivers tend to cancel more frequently than experienced ones.  
✅ ML prediction model achieved **82% accuracy** in forecasting ride cancellations.
